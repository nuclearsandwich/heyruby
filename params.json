{"name":"Hey Ruby‽","body":"***NOTE***: Heyruby is still in extreme infancy, so please refrain from\r\nTweeting or submitting anything anywhere until I can settle a few more things.\r\nDirect feedback to <steven@nuclearsandwich.com> is, of course, welcome!\r\n\r\nGood programmers are like scientists. When they want to answer a question They\r\nform a hypothesis, then verify it with an experiment. Rubyists have the\r\nexperimentation phase down, but we tend not to hypothesize fully.  This gem\r\nhelps people new to Ruby by prompting them for a hypothesis before returning the\r\nresult of their experiment.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis gem isn't really meant to go in your Gemfile, it's only utility is in\r\nnagging you to think a bit harder.\r\n\r\nInstall it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install heyruby\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGot a question? Ask Ruby!\r\nI wonder what the line `%w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten`\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n    $ heyruby\r\n    Hey Ruby‽> %w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten\r\n    What do you think the result of\r\n    ```\r\n    %w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    will be? (Type . on a line by itself when done)\r\n    | I should get a single array containing the strings [\"f\", \"b\", \"r\", \"b\",\r\n    | \"z\"].\r\n    | .\r\n    Were you right?\r\n    Try somthing else>\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Name\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWhen I was first learning Ruby in 2009 and 2010, my mental process for doing so\r\nwent along the lines of \"Hey Ruby, what's 2 + 2?\". This was so pervasive that\r\nfor some time I had `alias heyruby='irb'` in my bashrc. I hope that heyruby will\r\nhelp people new to Ruby to gain the same comfort and casual familiarity with the\r\nRuby language that I have been developing since those early days.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
