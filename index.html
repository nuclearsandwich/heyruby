        <p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: Heyruby is still in extreme infancy, so please refrain from
Tweeting or submitting anything anywhere until I can settle a few more things.
Direct feedback to <a href="mailto:steven@nuclearsandwich.com">steven@nuclearsandwich.com</a> is, of course, welcome!</p>

<p>Good programmers are like scientists. When they want to answer a question They
form a hypothesis, then verify it with an experiment. Rubyists have the
experimentation phase down, but we tend not to hypothesize fully.  This gem
helps people new to Ruby by prompting them for a hypothesis before returning the
result of their experiment.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>This gem isn't really meant to go in your Gemfile, it's only utility is in
nagging you to think a bit harder.</p>

<p>Install it yourself as:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install heyruby
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Got a question? Ask Ruby!
I wonder what the line <code>%w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten</code>
does.</p>

<pre><code>$ heyruby
Hey Ruby‽&gt; %w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten
What do you think the result of
```
%w[foo bar baz].map{ |s| s.split /[aeiou]/ }.flatten

```
will be? (Type . on a line by itself when done)
| I should get a single array containing the strings ["f", "b", "r", "b",
| "z"].
| .
Were you right?
Try somthing else&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Origin of the Name</h2>

<p>When I was first learning Ruby in 2009 and 2010, my mental process for doing so
went along the lines of "Hey Ruby, what's 2 + 2?". This was so pervasive that
for some time I had <code>alias heyruby='irb'</code> in my bashrc. I hope that heyruby will
help people new to Ruby to gain the same comfort and casual familiarity with the
Ruby language that I have been developing since those early days.</p>
